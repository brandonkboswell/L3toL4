    Controllers
      If you can, regenerate your controllers with the new Resourceful Controllers.

      All controllers are restful by default, so you won’t need to include $this->restful = true any more

      return Response::error(‘404’) becomes return App::abort(404)

      If you're hard-headed like me then don't forget to fix your snake_case
      ex: 'get_index' to 'getIndex'

      When Routing to these Controller Methods in L4
      You have to specify the get in the Route Declaration
      Ex: Route::get('/', 'HomeController@getIndex'); rather than Route::get('/', 'HomeController@index');

    Routing
      More Control with Controller Routing
        When issuing a route controller you now specify the uri and then the controller name, yay for more control!

        Route::controller('user', 'UserController');

      Routes now use {varname} syntax rather than (:type) syntax
      You also set your restrictions after with a method chain.
      Route::get('user/{id}', function($id)
      {

      })->where('id', '\d+'); <--- for numbers
      You can also set defaults 'yay!'
      ->defaults('page', 1);

      Be sure to convert something like get_update_merchant_account to getUpdateMerchantAccount and change the uri from update_merchant_account to update-merchant-account.
